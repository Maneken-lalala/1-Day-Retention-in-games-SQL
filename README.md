# 1-Day-Retention-in-games-SQL

In this project I am working with the data provided by Codecademy.com.
There are two tables with the following structure:

purchases:
|column name| data type|
|--|--|
|id|int|
|user_id|int|
|price|real|
|refunded_at|text|
|created_at|text|

gameplays - is a list of when the user played
|column name| data type|
|--|--|
|id|int|
|user_id|int|
|created_at|text|
|platform|text|
